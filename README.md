## Requirements

This software is created and is being maintained for users who are incorporated with Electrical and Electronic Circuits Design Engineering.

The main theme of this software is to use SVG graphics as the very base of Electrical and Electronic components imagery.

This is a single page web-application made only for PC right now. But in future it wil be extended to other devices as well.

To use the components well, we recommend to look at the guidelines in wiki page for what each components do and what purpose they are usually used for.
